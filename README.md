# IMDbBot
This project uses the Selenium library with Python to create a csv file of the user's votes on IMDb.  
In order for the application to work, the user's votes must be public.  

![IMDbPublic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67bf0303-b722-4763-8854-c88c22186696)  

All you have to do is run the app and paste the full address of your votes into the app.  
Your csv file will be created in the location where the application is running.
